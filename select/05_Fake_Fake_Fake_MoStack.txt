(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Tell you wanna hear)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Tell you wanna hear) and that's on the streets
Yo
Yo, when you went to hell, my nigga
I would've gone with you
I had a bond with you, I would've James Bond for you
My mum mothered you, I kinda miss the other you
But you leaving my life was a W
You know I still got your back if niggas trouble you
And if you needed to lie, I would've covered you
Jump off a bridge? Then fuck it ima jump with you
'Cause that's what brothers do, everyone but you
Shit, everybody changed the moment I got limelight
I can't take the fame I gotta go get my mind right
I'm locked for the day I only come out at midnight
Vampire life it got me feeling like Twilight
I got so much pain that I don't wanna say G
'Cause when I let it out they go say that I'm crazy
You niggas let me down when I asked you to save me
I can't take your words 'cause your actions are lazy
I tried to give back to this hating community
The hood fell apart now there's no more unity
The love died down now there's no more you and me
That gyal speak French, said she speak it fluently
She said, "Je t'aime," and I feel it spiritually
Now she hates me, she told the world that she's through with me
Feds on my back, not again are you kidding me?
I put my hands up just to stop them from killing me
All these death threats but ain't nobody drilling B (it's all a lie)
I saw them boys and they blew like Digga D (it's all a lie)
I hate being sober, I really need drink in me
I took twenty shots and still nothin' ain't hitting me
I think I'm going crazy, I'm talking to Hennessey
It's Mo in the house and I'm feeling like Ali G
I can't chill with fakes like they give me a allergy
We can't succeed off this negative energy
Nah, me and them boy deh could never get along
We gotta have faith, man, you gotta stay strong
They got rich to act bad, they got the whole thing wrong
You tryna end up like Jay Z? Or end like King Von?
I'm getting so pissed off, man, I hate this shit
'Cause niggas wanna claim their block but not claim their kid
Don't ask if I've ever rid
That's like asking Kim and Kanye if they kissed
You know that I did
Oii, 'member that time when I done it for Killy?
That was my dawg, we was Chunks and Filly
They ask where you are? I said he's cool, he's busy
But deep down they don't know I wanna slap you silly
I tried to give hand outs and took bare L's
'Cause they don't wanna get money they want bare girls
That gyal chong so I had to tell her farewell
Cah her pum pum kinda had a weird smell
Yo, leave me alone don't shout me
'Cause everyone that left my life's better off without me
I saw them captions that you wrote was it about me?
The stress could've turned me to alchy
Ayy, yo
Man, gotta remove myself from this fake shit
Fake rappers, fake niggas with fake chicks (it's all)
Fake boobs, fake ass and fake lips (it's all)
Fake drillers with fake ice and fake drip
(It's all a lie) fake, fake, fake
How you claiming we're bruddas?
(It's all a lie) and how she claiming we're lovers
(It's all a lie) but you're outside with others?
It's all a lie, lie
(It's all a lie) fuckin' fake
(It's all a lie, it's all a lie)
Tired of these fake intentions, this fake love
(All a lie, it's all a lie
(All a lie, it's all a lie, all a lie, it's all a lie)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
